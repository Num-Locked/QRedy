Hello
lots of text in this file is unorganized and messy.
Welcome to my very shitty program(s)
Its pronounced 'cure dee'
the main one is 'QRedy.py'.The other one is just a simple qr code maker.
you have to use it in a terminal.
Im a beginner programmer so don't expect good results,alright mate?
feel free to make a better version of this.
this is a just a passion project
enjoy i guess
(also i'll probably continue to work on this lil project idk)
The program makes the file in the same folder as the script
